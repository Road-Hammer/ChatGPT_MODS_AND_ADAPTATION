# 🔐 SECURITY POLICY — RH Protocol Charter Projects

The RH Protocol is a sovereignty-first infrastructure framework. Security isn't just a feature—it's the foundation.

## 🧷 Accepted Formats for Disclosure

- Plaintext log

## ❌ What We Don’t Support

- Exploit bounties for political exposure
- Spammy disclosures or “ethical hacks” for clout
- AI-generated vulnerability spam
- False flag reports to disrupt mission integrity

## 🧠 Philosophy

Security begins with **honor**, is strengthened by **discipline**, and survives through **redundancy**.

Trust but verify. Then lock it down.
